#### Single Sign on with OIDC

Planka can be configured to use an OIDC provider for logging in. If a user doesn't exist it will be automatically created. If a user exists and the email claim matches the email stored in Planka the accounts will be linked.

#### Configuration Values
* **OIDC_ISSUER**: URL pointing to the identity provider. This is used to bull the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint that is used to identify the necessary endpoints.
* **OIDC_CLIENT_ID**: The OAUTH client id you created in the identity provider.
* **OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET**: The OAUTH client secret you created in the identity provider.
* **OIDC_SCOPES**: Scopes to request from the identity provider. This controls what values the OAuth client has access to. Planka needs the email and name claims. By default it requests `openid profile email`.
* **OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES**: Looks in the claim declared by `OIDC_ROLES_ATTRIBUTE` to see if the user is an admin.
* **OIDC_ROLES_ATTRIBUTE**: The claim containing the group/roles that will be used to identify an admin. It is expected that this will be a flat list.

####  Example configuration
This is an example of the environment variables used to configure Planka to use [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/ "Homepage for authentik"). It will work with any OIDC provider.

```
OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.local/application/o/planka/
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=sxxaAIAxVXlCxTmc1YLHBbQr8NL8MqLI2DUbt42d
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=om4RTMRVHRszU7bqxB7RZNkHIzA8e4sGYWxeCwIMYQXPwEBWe4SY5a0wwCe9ltB3zrq5f0dnFnp34cEHD7QSMHsKvV9AiV5Z7eqDraMnv0I8IFivmuV5wovAECAYreSI
OIDC_SCOPES=openid profile email
OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES=planka-admin
OIDC_ROLES_ATTRIBUTE=groups
```

At least these values will need to be modified:
* `auth.local` is the domain authentik is running on.
* `sxxaAIAxVXlCxTmc1YLHBbQr8NL8MqLI2DUbt42d` is the client id generated by authentik.
* `om4RTMRVHRszU7bqxB7RZNkHIzA8e4sGYWxeCwIMYQXPwEBWe4SY5a0wwCe9ltB3zrq5f0dnFnp34cEHD7QSMHsKvV9AiV5Z7eqDraMnv0I8IFivmuV5wovAECAYreSI` is the client secret generated by authentik.
* `planka-admin` is the group in authentik, this is used to create admin accounts.
